# Serverless Image Processing

Contain the cdk pipeline in a new top level directory called `thumbing-serverless-cdk`

## Install CDK globally

This is so we can use the AWS CDK CLI for anywhere.

```sh
npm install aws-cdk -g
```

- Confirm by typing `cdk`

We'll add the install to our gitpod task file
```sh
  - name: cdk
    before: |
      npm install aws-cdk -g
```

## Initialize a new project

We'll initialize a new typescript cdk project within the folder we created:

```sh
cdk init app --language typescript
```

This will create several directories and files including a "thumbing-serverless-cdk/lib/thumbing-serverless-cdk-stack.ts" file which is where we will define all our IaC

- Manually or using the cli, create a new bucket on the console: assets.cruddur.com
```sh
aws s3 ls
```

- Create a .env.example file in thumbing-serverless-cdk directory to hold variables

- Install dotenv

```sh
npm i dotenv
```
- This should now show up in the package.json file in thumbing-serverless-cdk directory

## thumbing-serverless-cdk-stack.ts

In the thumbing-serverless-cdk-stack.ts file, add code to:

- Add/create bucket

  - [Bucket Construct](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_s3.Bucket.html)
  - [Removal Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v1/docs/@aws-cdk_core.RemovalPolicy.html)

- Load Env Vars
- Create Lambda
- Create SNS Topic
- Create an SNS Subscription
- Create S3 Event Notification to SNS
- Create S3 Event Notification to Lambda
- Create Policy for Bucket Access
- Create Policy for SNS Publishing
- Attach the Policies to the Lambda Role

## Lambdas

Create a new folder to hold the lambda functions in `aws/lambdas/process-images/`

  - Add the following files: `index.js`, `test.js`, `s3-image-processing.js`
  - We will add another file; `example.json`, to visualize the structure of our output
  - Do `cd aws/lambdas/process-images/` and run the following command: `npm init -y`
  - This will create `package.json` file in the directory
  - Installation:
    - Sharp: https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/install#aws-lambda
    
    ```sh
    npm i sharp
    npm i @aws-sdk/client-s3
    ```
  - Ignore node-modules in .gitignore

- Create a file to hold sharp installation: `bin/avatar/build`

- Give execute permission

## CDK Bootstrapping

> Deploying stacks with the AWS CDK requires dedicated Amazon S3 buckets and other containers to be available to AWS CloudFormation during deployment. 

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/bootstrapping.html

```sh
cdk bootstrap aws://ACCOUNT-NUMBER-1/REGION-1 aws://ACCOUNT-NUMBER-2/REGION-2 ...
```
Example:
```sh
cdk bootstrap aws://123456789012/us-east-1
cdk bootstrap 123456789012/us-east-1 123456789012/us-west-1
```

Run:

```sh
cdk bootstrap "aws://$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID/$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION"
```

- Go to the console, under CloudFormation. There should be a "CDKToolkit" stack

## Build

We can use build to catch errors prematurely.
This just builds tyescript

```sh
npm run build
```

## Synth

> The synth command is used to synthesize the AWS CloudFormation stack(s) that represent your infrastructure as code.

```sh
cdk synth
```
The command works a little similar to terraform plan. This should dump some files in cdk.out directory.

## Deploy

```sh
cdk deploy
```

## List Stacks

```sh
cdk ls
```

- Check CloudFormantion, S3 and Lambda for resources

- Write scripts to upload and clear s3: bin/avatar/upload, bin/avatar/clear
- Give execute permissions
- Add the file to upload: bin/avatar/files/data.jpg (https://github.com/omenking/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/week-8-again/bin/avatar/files/data.jpg)
- Upload `./bin/avatar/upload`
- Confirm if this triggered the Lambda function and check the CloudWatch logs. Check S3 for processed output folder (make sure file output is in jpg)

- Update .gitpod.yml (just confirm)


## Desroy Stacks

```sh
cdk destroy
```

# Implement Users Profile Page

> N.B: Before you can run docker compose, you must login to ecr /bin/ecr/login

- Edit backend-flask/Dockerfile

- Create a bash script to bootstrap major tasks: bin/bootstrap
- Create new files: frontend-react-js/src/components/ProfileHeading.js and frontend-react-js/src/components/ProfileHeading.css
  - **You will need to modify something here to be specific to you**

# Implement Migrations Backend Endpoint and Profile Form

- Create a bash script to prepare all databases: bin/prepare
- Give it execute permissions

- Create the migration directory and add a .keep file: backend-flask/db/migrations/.keep

- Give execute permission to the migration file:
```sh
chmod u+x bin/generate/migration
```

- Run the file:
```sh
./bin/generate/migration add_bio_column
```

- Confirm the file is generated in backend-flask/db/migrations/
- Edit this generated file as shown: https://github.com/omenking/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/week-8-again/backend-flask/db/migrations/16812294605993273_add_bio_column.py

- Create files: bin/db/migrate and bin/db/rollback
- Give execute permission to both files

- Run the migrate and rollback files:
```sh
./bin/db/migrate

./bin/db/rollback
```

- You can confirm by connecting to psql

# Implement Avatar Uploading

- To start things up, run the bootstrap script, then docker-compose, then db/setup, then ddb/schema-load, then ddb/seed, then migrate

## Setup Lambda function to use in API Gateway

- Go to Lambda > Function > Create function
  - Function name: CruddurAvatarUpload
  - Runtime: Ruby 2.7
  - Architecture: x86_64
  - Execution role: Create a new role with basic Lambda permissions
  - Create

- Create new directory and file: aws/lambdas/cruddur-upload-avatar/function.rb

- Generate a Gemfile in this directory:

```sh
cd aws/lambdas/cruddur-upload-avatar/

bundle init
```
- This will generate a Gemfile in the directory
- Modify the Gemfile as shown: https://github.com/omenking/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/week-8-again/aws/lambdas/cruddur-upload-avatar/Gemfile
- Run the following command:
```sh
bundle install
```

- You can set the following env variables in your workspace:
```sh
export UPLOADS_BUCKET_NAME="cruddur-uploaded-avatars"
gp env UPLOADS_BUCKET_NAME="cruddur-uploaded-avatars"
```

- Run the function.rb exec
```sh
bundle exec ruby function.rb
```
- This returns a presigned url which we can use to upload data

+ You can test this using extensions like postman or alternative like thunder client
  - Go to New Request
  - Enter the presigned url
  - Drop down and choose "PUT"
  - Click "Send"
+ Upload the image and confirm that it shows on s3. You can delete the image from s3 afterwards.

- We need to package this as a ruby Lambda

- In the CruddurAvatarUpload Lambda created, paste the function.rb code and click Deploy
- Under the Configuration tab, go to Permissions and click into the Role name
  - Drop down permissions and add in-line policy
  - Under Visual editor:
    - Service: S3
    - Actions: PutObject
    - Resources: Check "Specific" and click "Add ARN"
      - Bucket name: cruddur-uploaded-avatars
      - Object name: Check "Any"
      - Add
    - Review Policy
      - Name: PresignedUrlAvatarPolicy
    - Create
- Expand that policy and copy the json code
- Create a new file to hold the policy: aws/policies/s3-upload-avatar-presigned-url-policy.json
- Under the Configuration tab, go to Environment variables and click Edit
  - Key: UPLOADS_BUCKET_NAME
  - Value: cruddur-uploaded-avatars
  - Save
- Under the "Code" section, go to "Runtime settings" and click Edit
  - Change "Handler" to function.handler
- If necessary, rename the function in the "Code" tab to 'function.rb'
- Deploy 
- Go to the "Test" tab and click "Test"

- Modify erb/frontend-react-js.env.erb to reflect the API_GATEWAY_ENDPOINT_URL (ie the invoke url)

- Modify frontend-react-js/src/lib/CheckAuth.js

//
+ At some point, we had to zip the contents of aws/lambdas/cruddur-upload-avatar/, which includes function.rb, Gemfile and Gemfile.lock and save the zip as ruby-lambda.zip.
+ Now, in the Lambda > CruddurAvatarUpload, upload as zip and choose ruby-lambda.zip
//
